java cStatistics 5200 Fall 2024
Minchul Shin
Project
The project for Stat 5200 has two options. (i) Duplicate and discuss the analysis in an 
existing empirical paper that uses econometric techniques taught in the course. Your 
discussion should include criticism of the analyses carried out and the conclusions 
reached in the paper, if such criticism is warranted. If you choose this option, you are 
also encouraged to consider additional statistical analyses the author(s) did not 
undertake—either perform the additional analyses or discuss what other and/or additional 
approaches you deem appropriate. Note that you are not required to duplicate all of the 
analysis in the paper. (ii) Use a data set of your own choice and execute an analysis. 
The project is due Thursday, 19th December, at 11:59 p.m. 
The final report should include the following sections: (1) introduction of the problem of 
interest; (2) description of the data; (3) description of the models that will be fit to 
address the economic problem of interest; (4) presentation of the fitted models, with 
interpretation of the results (and place the R code in an appendix); (5) conclusions from 
the analysis performed about the economic problem of in代 写program、Java/Python

discussion of limitations of the study. 
For this project you are required to work individually. 
I want to limit the length of your report. Your presentation should not exceed 15 pages, 
exclusive of the appendix containing code.
Submit to me a brief proposal, no more than a page, describing the problem to be 
considered, the data set you plan to use, what analyses you plan to duplicate, and what 
additional analyses you plan to consider (if you have chosen the first option). If you 
subsequently decide to change your topic, a new proposal is required. This brief research 
paper proposal will be a part of one of homework questions (sometime in October).
I will be available to discuss your project with you. Either come to my office hours or 
arrange an appointment. 
A good source of data from published papers is the Journal of Applied Econometrics
Data Archive. It is available at https://journaldata.zbw.eu/journals/jae. The American 
Economic Association maintains a web page with resources for economists on the 
Internet. It lists economics journals which maintain data archives. The url is
